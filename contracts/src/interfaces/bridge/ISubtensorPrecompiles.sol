///              in `allowance(...)`), and
///           2. only the load-bearing entrypoints are pinned here (the ticket's "minimal local

/// @dev Precompile addresses verified against `reference/subtensor/precompiles/src/` (Rust source)
///      AND against Project Rubicon's verified production `LiquidStakedV3` (`reference/rubicon/`):

///      IMPORTANT: on Subtensor's Frontier EVM a *typed* call to these precompiles "never reaches the
///      runtime precompile" (see `reference/evm-bittensor/solidity/stakeV2.sol`). The wrapper therefore
///      invokes the state-changing entrypoints via low-level `call` with `abi.encodeWithSelector` and
///      reads the views via `staticcall`. These interfaces exist only to source the 4-byte selectors
///      and to decode return data — they are never used as a call target directly.
